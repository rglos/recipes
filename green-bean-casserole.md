# Green Bean Casserole

## Ingredients:

### For the onions:
- 2 tbsp butter
- 2 or 3 yellow onions, sliced
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tbsp sherry vinegar (stirred into the onions after they are caramelized)

### For the white sauce:
- 2 tbsp butter
- 2 1/2 tbsp flour
- 2 1/2 cups milk
- pinch of nutmeg
- cayenne to taste
- 1/4 tsp dried thyme
- salt and pepper to taste

### For the topping:
- 2/3 cup panko or other style bread crumbs
- 2 tbsp melted butter

### For the rest:
- 2 lbs green beans, trimmed, blanched
- salt and pepper to taste
- 4 oz grated Gruyere cheese, divided
- 1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch casserole dish.

### Step 2
Heat 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir the onions into the pan; cook and stir until very soft and golden brown, about 15 minutes. Stir in sherry vinegar. Transfer to a small bowl, and reserve.

### Step 3
In the same skillet, melt 2 more tablespoons butter. Whisk in 2 tablespoons flour. Stirring constantly, cook over medium heat until the flour smells like baked pie crust, about 3 minutes. Slowly whisk in milk, about 1/2 cup at a time, then whisk in nutmeg, cayenne pepper, and thyme. Bring to simmer, and cook until thickened, whisking constantly, 3 more minutes. Transfer to a bowl and reserve.

### Step 4
Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in clean skillet; stir in panko until all crumbs are coated; reserve.

### Step 5
Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil over medium heat, and boil beans until bright green and crisp but not raw tasting, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain very well.

### Step 6
Spoon half of the caramelized onions into the prepared casserole dish; top with green beans. Season with salt and black pepper. Spread reserved white sauce over the green beans; sprinkle with half of the Gruyere cheese. Top with the rest of the onions, and use the back of a spoon to push onions down into sauce and cheese. Top with the buttered panko crumbs, the remaining Gruyere, and Parmesan cheese.

### Step 7
Bake in the preheated oven until hot throughout and lightly browned, about 30 minutes. Let sit 10 minutes before serving.
