# Thin Crust Pizza

## Ingredients

| ingredient | 2 * 12 inch crusts | 2 * 14 inch crusts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| flour | 225g | 300g |
| sugar | 5g (about 1 teaspoon) | 7g (about 1 1/2 teaspoons) |
| salt | 5g (about 1 teaspoon) | 7g (about 1 1/4 teaspoons) |
| yeast |  1 gram (about 1/4 teaspoon) | 1 gram (about 1/4 teaspoon) |
| water | 115g | 150g |
| olive oil | 22.5g | 30g |

## Directions

### Step 1 - Make the dough

- Combine the flour, sugar, salt and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer. 
- Whisk together to combine
- then add the water and oil. 
- Mix at low speed with the dough hook attachment, stopping occasionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula, until the dough comes together in a shaggy ball. 
- Cover the bowl and let the dough rest for 10 minutes. 
- Mix on medium-low speed until the dough is silky and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 5 minutes. 
- Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface.

### Step 2 - Divide the dough

- Using a bench scraper or knife, cut the dough into two even pieces, about 250 grams each. 
- Using lightly floured hands, shape each piece into a smooth ball, then lightly coat each with oil, using your hands to cover every surface. 
- Transfer each ball to a quart-size zipper-lock bag or other sealable container at least three times its volume. (Quart-size plastic deli containers also work for this.)

### Step 3 - Ferment the dough

- For good results, let the dough rest at room temperature until doubled in volume, about 3 hours. 
- For better results, refrigerate the dough overnight. 
- For best results, refrigerate the dough for at least 3 and up to 5 days.

### Step 4 - The day before baking, roll the dough

- Transfer one dough ball to a work surface generously dusted with semolina or cornmeal. (Refrigerated dough can be rolled straight out of the fridge, though allowing it to rest covered for 1 hour at room temperature will make rolling easier.)
- Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a very thin circle 14 inches in diameter, lifting and rotating it occasionally (use a ruler or measuring tape to ensure the right size). 
- Repeat with the second ball.
- If the dough feels like it keeps bouncing back as you try and stretch it, cover it with an inverted bowl or a clean kitchen towel, let it rest for half an hour, then try rolling again.

### Step 5 - Cure the dough

- Transfer the doughs to a flat surface lined with parchment paper or butcher paper. 
- Allow to rest uncovered at room temperature overnight. 
- The top surface of the dough should end up dry to the touch with a leathery feel. 
- If they puff at all during curing, you can push any bubbles with a fork and push them down to flatten them.
