# Baked Salmon

## Ingredients

 - 1 1/2-2 lbs. whole salmon fillet

## Lemon, Garlic, Dill and Caper Butter Sauce

 - 1/2 cup salted butter, melted
 - 2-3 cloves fresh garlic, minced
 - 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
 - 2 teaspoons lemon zest
 - ⅛ teaspoon dried red pepper flakes
 - ¼ cup fresh dill, chopped or 1 tablespoon dried
 - 1 tablespoon capers
 - Salt and pepper to taste

## Directions

Allow salmon filet to rest at room temperature for 20 minutes. Pat gently with a paper towel.

While the salmon rests, make the butter sauce

## Lemon, Garlic, Dill and Caper Butter Sauce

Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and sauté for 30 seconds. Add lemon juice, lemon zest and dried red pepper flakes and cook on medium heat for about 3 more minutes to reduce the sauce. Remove the saucepan from heat and add dill and capers. Season with salt and fresh ground black pepper.

Place salmon, skin side down, on a large baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper.

Spoon sauce evenly over the top of the fillet.


Bake at 400° F or 200°C for 12-15 minutes depending on the thickness of salmon. Check for doneness with a thermometer, if cooking fillet through to done, aim for no more than 140°F as the salmon will continue to cook a little after removing it from the oven, or use a fork to gently pull back on a section in the thickest part of the filet. The salmon should flake away easily and look opaque.

Serve on warmed plates.
