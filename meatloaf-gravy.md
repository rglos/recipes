# Meatloaf Gravy

The stock makes the gravy.  Make your own stock.  This also freezes well.

## Ingredients

- 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter
- 1 medium yellow onion, chopped (135g)(about 1 cup)
- 1/2 carrot, peeled and chopped (40g)(about 1/3 cup)
- 1 rib celery, chopped (85g)(about 1/2 cup)
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/3 cup flour (40g)
- 4 cups beef stock (960g)
- 1 bouget garni (1 bay leaf, 2 sprigs thyme, 3 sprigs italian parsley, tied together)
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper

Optional:

- Mushrooms

## Directions

1. Place medium saucepan over medium-high heat for several minutes.  Add the butter, onions, carrots, and celery at the same time and saute until the vegetables start to brown around the edges, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, reduce heat to medium so the garlic doesn't burn, and continue to cook until vegetables are soft, another 5 minutes.  Add the flour and mix well to make a roux.  Cook stirring frequently, for about 3 minutes.
1. Stire the stock into the vegetables, a little at a time, letting the roux absorb the liquid before adding more (this will help to prevent lumps).  Bring the gravy to a boil over high, then reduce to medium so it simmers.  Add the bouget garni, cover, and simmer for about 45 minutes; skim off any scum that arises to the surface.
1. Season with the salt and pepper, service with Meatloaf recipe or any other red meat.
