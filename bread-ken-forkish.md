**Bulk Fermentation:** 12 to 14 hours

**Proof time:** About 1/4 hours

| Ingredient | Quantity | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| White Flour | 1,000 g | - |
| Water | 780 g, 90 F to 95 F | - |
| White Flour | 1,000 g | - |
| Fine sea salt | 22 g | 1 tbsp + 1 tsp |
| Yeast | 0.8 g | Scant 1/4 tsp |

## Directions

1. **Autolyse** - combine the 1000g of flour with 780g of water in container.  Mix by hand just until incorporated. Cover and let rest 20-30 minutes.
2. **Mix** - sprinkle the 22 g of salt and the 0.8 g of yeast evenly over the top of the dough.  Mix by hand, wetting your working hand before mixing so the dough doesn't stick to you.  Use the pincer method to fully integrate the ingredients.  Let rest for 30 minutes.
3. **Fold** - this dough needs two or three folds.  Fold and let rest 30 minutes between each fold.  After doing the last fold, cover dough and let it continue to rise overnight at room temperature.
4. **Divide** - in morning, flour working surface, divide dough in two
5. **Shape** - dust 2 proofing baskets with flour and shape each piece of dough into medium-tight ball and place seam side down in its proofing basket
6. **Proof** - lightly flour the tops of loaves and set them side by side and cover with a kitchen towel. Plan on baking the loaves about 1 1/4 hours after shaped
1. **Preheat** - at least 45 minutes prior to baking, put a rack in the middle of the over and put 1 or 2 dutch ovens on rack with lids on at 475 F.
1. **Bake** - invert proofed loaf into lightly floured surface, keep in mind that the top of the loaf will be the side that was facing down while it was rising - the seam side.  Remove dutch oven, place loaf inside, replace lid, but in oven for 30 minutes.  Remove the lid after 30 minutes and bake another 20 to 30 minutes.
