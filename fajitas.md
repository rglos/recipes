# Fajitas

## Ingredients - Fajitas

 - 650g/1.5lbs boneless skinless chicken thighs 
 - 1 large red onion or white - red is for color
 - 450g bell peppers (1 large red, yellow, and orange bell) 
 - 100g or 1 large poblano 
 - 12g or 2 1/2t salt 
 - 2g or 1t black pepper 
 - 10g or 2t garlic powder 
 - 10g or 3t onion powder 
 - 10g or 3 1/2t ground cumin 
 - 10g or 3 1/2t chili powder 
 - 1g or 1t red pepper flakes 
 - 1g or 1/2t dried oregano 
 - Juice of 1 lime 
 - 25g or 2T olive oil

## Directions - Fajitas

 1. Preheat your oven and sheet pan on 500F/260C. 
 1. Cut chicken into strips that are ½-¼” wide (1cm or so). Add to a bowl. 
 1. Cut onion in half, pole to pole, then slice into ¼” pieces <1cm, parallel to the poles. Add to bowl with chicken. 
 1. Slice of the sides and bottom of the bell peppers so you’re left with large planks that leave behind most of the ribs and seeds.  Remove any white pith left behind on the peppers then slice the pepper planks into about a ½” or 1.5cm. Add to the bowl with chicken and onions. 
 1. Slice off the outer planks of the poblano, leaving behind the core and seeds and slice into the same size as the bell peppers. Add to bowl. 
 1. Add salt pepper, spices/herbs, lime, and olive oil into bowl and mix to coat. 
 1. Spread meat and veg onto a flat layer on your now preheated sheet tray - you should hear a sizzle. Return tray to 500f/260C oven and cook for 15 minutes, gently stirring halfway through. 
 1. Remove sheet tray from oven, and stir chicken and veg once more, turn the oven broiler on high and load sheet tray under the broiler to take on some nice char for about 3 minutes, stir, then return to broiler for another 2-3 minutes, keeping an eye on things to be sure it doesn’t burn. At this point, the chicken and veg should all have some nice browning and charred bits, kind of like you’d get on a grill.
