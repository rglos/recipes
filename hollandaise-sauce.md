# Hollandaise Sauce

## Hand Blender Hollandaise

Yield: About 1 cup Hollandaise

### Ingredients

- 2 large egg yolks
- 1 teaspoon (5ml) water
- 1 tablespoon (15ml) lemon juice from 1 lemon
- Kosher salt, optional
- 1 stick (4 ounces; 113g) unsalted butter
- Pinch cayenne pepper or hot sauce, optional

Notes: Use a jar or cup just wide enough to fit the head of your immersion blender. The egg yolk/lemon/water mixture in step one should reach the blades of the blender.

### Directions

1. Combine the egg yolks, water, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt in a cup or jar that's just wide enough to accommodate the head of your hand blender (see note).

2. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat, swirling constantly, until foamy and bubbling. Transfer the butter to a liquid measuring cup, leaving behind any milky white liquid at the bottom.

3. Place head of immersion blender into the bottom of the cup and turn it on. With the blender constantly running, slowly pour the hot butter into the measuring up, letting it run down the shaft of the hand blender. Continue pouring slowly until all the butter is added. The hollandaise should be thick and creamy. Season to taste with salt and a pinch of cayenne pepper or hot sauce, as desired. You can adjust the consistency of the sauce with a little bit of water if you prefer it thinner. It should flow very gently like lava when you spoon it onto a plate.

4. Serve immediately, or place the blender jar in a hot water bath and keep it in a warm place for up to 30 minutes before serving. Leftover hollandaise can't be reheated, so eat up!
