## Directions

My directions that doesn't require a 2nd pot, and uses authentic chicken stock if you make it at home - substitute if you want.

- Melt butter in large pot over medium heat, add onion and saute until soft.
- Reduce heat, stir in flour, DO NOT BROWN
- Stir in 4 cups of COLD chicken stock (as per Chef John, "hot roux, cold milk, no lumps" [source](https://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2010/04/secret-to-lump-free-sauce.html))
- Stir in pickle juice
- Heat until soup thickens slightly boiling
- Add seasonings - salt, pepper, dill
- Add pickles
- Stir in cream for desired texture
