# Meatloaf

I often double this to make 2 meatloafs; 1 to cook now and another to throw in the freezer for later.

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons (30g) butter
- 1 large yellow onion, finely chopped (135g) (about 1 1/4 cups)
- 1 medium green bell pepper, finely diced (120g) (about 1 cup)
- 1 large rib celery, finely diced (85g) (about 1/2 cup)
- 2 large eggs
- 2 pounds 80 percent lean ground beef (I've used grass fed and higher lean no problem)
- 2 teaspoons dried thyme
- 1/2 cup rolled oats (26g)
- 1/2 cup ketchup divided (64g each / 128 total)
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1 1/2 teaspsoons black pepper
- 3 strips of bacon
- 2 cups Meatloaf Gravy (see other recipe)

## Directions

1. Heat a large 12/14 inch saute pan over medium-high heat for several minutes.  When hot, add the butter, onions, green peppers, and celery.  Cook until the vegetables start to brown slightly, about 5 minutes. Continue to cook until they are very tender, about 15 minutes (lower the heat if they are browning too much).  Transfer the vegetables to a plate to cool (can cook day ahead and referidgerate).
1. Heat the oven to 350F.  Grease a standard-size loaf pan.  Whisk eggs in a large bowl.  Add the cooled sauteed vegetables, ground beef, thyme, oats, 1/4 cup of the ketchup, salt, and pepper.  Mix thoroughly but gently.
1. Press the beef mixture into the prepared pan.  Pound the pan a couple of times on the counter to get rid of air pockets.  Turn the loaf over onto baking sheet (line with parchment or silicone baking mat).  Spread the top of the loaf with remaining 1/4 cup ketchup.  Arrange 3 bacon strips lengthwise on top.
1. Bake for 1 hour, or until thermometer registers 155F in the center.  (I like to also make sure I get things carmelized.  Might require a tempurature boost for 10-15 towards the end)
1. Remove from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes. Slice and serve with meatloaf gravy, and/or refridgerate and serve in sandwiches.
