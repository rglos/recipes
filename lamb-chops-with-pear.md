# Lamb Chops with Pear

## Ingredients

 * 4 medium lamb loin chops, fat trimmed
 * 1/4 tsp. fine sea salt
 * 1/4 tsp. ground black pepper
 * 1/4 C. unsweetened apple juice
 * 1/4 C. low-sodium beef broth
 * 1 1/2 tsp. balsamic vinegar
 * 1/2 firm-ripe pear, peeled, cored and cut into 1/4-inch slices
 * 3/4 tsp. fresh rosemary, chopped

## Directions

Sprinkle lamb with salt and pepper. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Add lamb, and cook about 4 minutes per side for medium. Transfer lamb to plates and cover to keep warm. Discard any fat from skillet and return to medium heat. Add apple juice, broth, vinegar and pear to skillet, and cook, scraping up any browned bits in the bottom of the pan until liquid is reduced by about half, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in herbs. Top lamb with pears and pan sauce, and serve. Garnish with additional rosemary.
