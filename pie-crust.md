# Pie Crust

Make a double batch of this, and freeze the individually wrapped dough for future.

## Ingredients

- 2 1/2 cups flour (300g)
- 1 cup unsalted butter (2 sticks or 227g) - chilled, cut into tablespoon size pieces - after cutting into pieces, freeze
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 7 tablespoons ice water (105g)
- 1 tablespoon cider vinegar (15g)

## Directions

- Cut butter into chunks and freeze
- Combine flour, salt, and butter in a food processor. Pulse until mixture resembles coarse crumbs, about 10 1-second pulses.
- Pour half the ice water and vinegar mixture into the flour and butter mixture. Pulse to combine, about 3 (1-second) pulses. Pour in remaining ice water and vinegar mixture. Pulse until mixture just starts to come together, about 8 (1-second) pulses.
- Turn dough out onto a wooden surface or silicon baking mat, pat into round shape and divide in half. Form each half into a disc about 5 inches wide.
- Wrap each disc in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes until ready to use.
