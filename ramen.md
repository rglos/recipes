# Ramen

## Dashi (stock - chicken or beef)

- Homeade broth
- Shiitake mushrooms

## Tare and Chashu (marinade and pork) 

 - 1 1/4 cup soy sauce
 - 1 1/4 cup mirin
 - 1/2 cup sake
 - 1 1/2 cup water
 - 1/4 cup granulated sugar
 - 2 tbsp. packed brown sugar
 - 1 2" piece fresh ginger, sliced
 - 3 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed
 - 3 green onions, halved
 - 1 lb. pork belly, skin on, cut into 2"-wide strips

In a medium saucepan over medium heat, bring all ingredients except pork to a low simmer and reduce heat to low.

Place pork in tare pot and bring to a simmer. Cover and continue to cook on low until tender, turning pork occasionally, about 1 hour 20 minutes.

Let cool for 20 minutes, then strain and reserve liquid for serving. Refrigerate pork and remaining liquid separately. Slice pork before serving, lightly torched, if desired.

Once chilled in fridge, remove fat from top of tare from pork belly.

## Nitamago (marinated eggs)

 - 1 ¼ cups water
 - 6 large cold eggs

Place water into a 3-quart saucepan with a lid. Place over high heat and bring to a low boil. Carefully place the eggs in the water. Cover pan immediately, reduce heat to medium-high, and cook for 9 1/2 minutes. Remove pan from heat and cool eggs down with cold running water, tipping out the water, and continuing to run cold water over the eggs until they are cool.

Transfer eggs to an ice bath and let rest for 5 minutes. Thoroughly crack eggshells very gently, knocking one egg against another, then return to ice bath for 10 more minutes. Peel carefully.

Place eggs in a medium bowl and pour reserved pork-marinade liquid over. Weigh down eggs with reserved spent kombu (kelp) to fully immerse in liquid. Let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, up to 12 hours.

## To Serve

In a pot of salted boiling water, cook ramen, stirring with tongs or chopsticks until al dente, about 1 minute. (If using instant ramen, discard seasoning packet and follow packet instructions to cook until al dente.) Drain well.

In a small saucepan over medium heat, warm dashi and shiitake until barely simmering. Cook for 1 minute and remove from heat. Set shiitake aside.

Add dashi, tare, and noodles to serving bowl. Top with chashu, nitamago, shiitake, green onion, a drizzle of la-yu, and nori, if using.
