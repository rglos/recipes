# INSTRUCTIONS
Prepare the chermoula first. It can be made up to two days ahead of time. In a dry skillet set over medium heat, toast the cumin seeds and corianter seeds, shaking constantly, about 1 minute or until fragrant. Let cool, then grind in a spice grinder or mortar and pestle. In a food processor, blend ground spices with remaining ingredients until pureed.

Wash and pat chicken dry. Make a seasoned flour mixture by combining flour with cumin, turmeric, salt and pepper. Dredge the chicken in the seasoned flour mixture. Reserve what remains.

In a Dutch oven set over medium-high heat, heat the olive oil. Put the chicken pieces in the pot, skin side-down. Brown about 3 minutes on each side. Remove the chicken to a plate.

Add the onion and garlic to the pot and cook 2-3 minutes, or until onion is translucent. Sprinkle in the reserved flour mixture, and stir until lightly browned. Pour in the wine and chicken broth and cook until slightly thickened. Add the tomatoes, olives and raisins. Stir to combine.

Return the chicken to the pot. Cover and cook 2-3 hours, until meat reaches 170 F. Serve over yellow rice and garnish with chermoula, parsley and lemon zest.
