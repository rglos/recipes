# Huevos Rancheros

## Ingredients

 - 2 white onions
 - 4 Roma tomatoes, cored
 - 2 jalapenos
 - 2 serrano peppers
 - 6 garlic cloves (divided)
 - 2  guajillo chiies finely chopped
 - Bacon grease or fry oil 
 - Corn tortillas
 - Eggs
 - Shredded cheese, for sprinkling

## Directions

Begin by preparing the vegetables: Core the tomatoes, slice the stems off the jalapeno and serrano peppers and remove the seeds, if desired to reduce the spiciness. Slice the onions in half, but keep the root intact. 

Fill a large saucepan about halfway with water. Add all the vegetables and 4 of the garlic cloves. Bring to a boil for about 10 minutes or until the tomatoes are tender, adding more water if needed. 

Remove the vegetables with a slotted spoon and let cool. Peel the outer skin of the tomatoes off and discard (soaking them in cold water beforehand, will release the skin easier). Cut the stems off the jalapeno and serrano peppers, and remove the seeds, if desired. Remove the root of the onions. 

Add all the vegetables, along with the remaining 2 garlic cloves to a blender, and diced guajillo peppers and  Salt and pepper, to taste. Blend until smooth. 

Pour the contents in a saucepan to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer, cover and continue to cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. 

Meanwhile, heat about 1 tablespoon of bacon grease or oil in a cast iron skillet. Add the tortillas and flip to coat with grease on both sides. Cook until they bubble up slightly and warm through on both sides. Be sure not to overcook until crispy. 

Return to the skillet, adding more grease if needed, and add the egg(s). Fry until over-easy. 

Take the tortillas and top with the egg followed by some sprinkled cheese and then the sauce. Top with more cheese. Serve immediately.
