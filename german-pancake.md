# German Pancake or Dutch Baby

## Ingredients

- 3 large eggs, at room temperature
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup whole milk, at room temperature
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- Pinch of nutmeg
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- Syrup, preserves, confectioners' sugar or cinnamon sugar

## Directions

- Heat oven to 425 degrees.
- Combine eggs, flour, milk, sugar and nutmeg in a blender jar and blend until very smooth. Batter may also be mixed by hand.
- Place butter in a heavy 10-inch skillet and place in the oven. As soon as the butter has melted (watch it so it does not burn) add the batter to the pan, return pan to the oven and bake for 20 minutes, until the pancake is puffed and golden. Lower oven temperature to 300 degrees and bake 5 minutes longer.
- Remove pancake from oven, cut into wedges and serve at once topped with syrup, preserves, confectioners' sugar or cinnamon sugar.

## Notes

> My Dutch baby did not pouf the first time I made it. Then I remembered that successful Yorkshire pudding requires room temperature ingredients. So my 2nd Dutch Baby was made with ingredients at room temperature and- poof- I got plenty of pouf, even at altitude in the mountains of Colorado.

> For my 12 cast iron skillet, this didn't make enough. I've adjusted the amounts as follows:
4 eggs
3/4 cup flour
3/4 cup milk
1 1/2 tbsp sugar
... and the rest I kept the same.

> Banana Baby! Have a surplus of bananas, so sliced 4 into the hot butter (used an extra T of butter), sprinkled on about 2T turbinado sugar, left sugar out of the batter. Puffed up gorgeous, done in 18 minutes. Served with brandied cranberries left over from holidays to offset sweet bananas. Happy breakfast! Gets a rare 5 stars from here.
