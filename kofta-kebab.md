# Kofta Kebab

- 1 medium yellow onion, quartered
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 whole bunch parsley, stems removed (about 2 packed cups parsley leaves)
- 1 lb ground beef
- 1 lb ground lamb
- 1 slice of bread, toasted until browned and soaked in water until fully tender, or just add breadcrumbs, or panko breadcrumbs
- Salt and pepper
- 1 1/2 tsp ground allspice - if you don't have whole allspice, mix together equal parts ground nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1/2 tsp ground green cardamom
- 1/2 tsp ground sumac
- 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg
- 1/2 tsp paprika

1. In a food processor, chop the onion, garlic, and parsley.
1. Add the beef, lamb, bread (be sure to squeeze out the water completely) / breadcrumbs, and the spices. Run the processor until all is well combined forming a pasty meat mixture.
1. Remove the meat mixture from the food processor and place in a large bowl. Take a fistful portion of the meat mixture and mold it on a skewer.
1. Optionally, freeze in a ball for later use.
