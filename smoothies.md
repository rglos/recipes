## Going Green Smoothie

 - 1 cup (120 ml) water
 - 1 cup (170 g) green grapes
 - ½ cup (85 g) pineapple
 - ½ banana peeled
 - 2 cups (60 g) fresh spinach
 - ½ cup (70 g) ice cubes

 From reviews:

 Orange instead of grapes:

 > I have a green smoothie every morning and would suggest major upgrades to your recipe. First, skip the water and ice and use 1 cup of cold vanilla soymilk instead. Use 1 whole banana including the peel (wash well in warm water). Also, there are more nourishing fruits than green grapes (try a large orange or red grapefruit with peel). Finally, vary and mix the greens and add a handful of frozen blueberries. You will have increased protein, fiber, potassium, vitamin D & C and, will have more interesting flavours.

 Blend the spinach + water first

 > Love it! This is my every day breakfast. I always make a few substitutions, including no ice, using frozen fruit, using whichever fruit is in season etc. But my biggest recommendation is to blend the spinach and water together FIRST. I blend my spinach and water alone for 20-30 seconds (until the spinach is completely liquid and no fibers or chunks remain) before adding the frozen fruit. I don't like the bubbly texture that happens when leafy greens are blended, and doing this first completely eliminates that, as well as emulsifies the spinach completely in the water. I've also read that releasing chlorophyll completely from the veg like that is good for you, but I have no clue if that's true. Regardless, it gives the smoothie a better texture, which is what really matters to me.
