# Pickled Red Onion

## Ingredients

- 1 large red onion, peeled and very thinly sliced (use mandoline)
- 3/4 cup apple cider vinegar
- 1/4 cup water (or skip the water and use all vinegar)
- 1 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 1â€“2 tablespoons sweetener (such as maple syrup, honey, sugar, etc.)
- (Optional) Peppercorns or freshly-cracked black pepper

## Directions

- Heat the vinegar mixture. In a small saucepan, stir together the vinegar, water, salt and your desired amount of sweetener. Cook over medium-high heat until the mixture reaches a simmer.
- Combine in a jar. Place the thinly-sliced onions in a mason jar. Pour the hot vinegar mixture over the onions, screw on the lid, and shake the onions briefly until they are evenly coated with the vinegar mixture.
- Marinate. Let the onions marinate for 30 minutes. (You may need to press the onions down with a spoon so that they are all submerged under the vinegar mixture.)
