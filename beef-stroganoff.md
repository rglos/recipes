# Beef Stroganoff - Braised

- 2 - 2.5 lbs of beef chuck or tough beef cut into 1/2 inch strips
- 1 lb of mushrooms
- salt and pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons oil
- 1-2 tablespoons of butter
- 1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour or 3/4 cup yogurt
- 3 medium yellow onions, peeled and sliced
- 1/2 cup white wine
- 2 cups beef broth or water if you don't have broth
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 3/4 cup creme fraiche, sour cream, or yogurt
- fresh parsely for garnish

# Directions

- Braise the beef, step 1 - Preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Season the beef all over with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a stew pot over high heat. When hot, add the beef and cook, in batches if needed, until browned. Transfer to a plate.
- Braise the beef, step 2 - Reduce heat to medium-low, add butter, add the onions and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened, about 15 minutes. Add the white wine, 2 cups of beef broth or water and a pinch of salt, scraping the caramelized bits stuck to the bottom of the pan. Return the beef and its juices to the pot and bring to a boil. Cover, place in the oven and cook until the beef is tender, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours.
- Make the sauce - Transfer the beef and 1/4 of the onions to a large plate. Purée the remaining onions and cooking liquid in a blender with the mustard and yogurt/sour cream/creme fraiche, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Return the beef and the reserved onions to the cooking pot and stir in the sauce.
- Make the mushrooms - Melt the butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and sauté until tender. Season with salt, and add to the pot. 
- Make the egg noodles - If you choose, serve over buttered egg noodles.
- Garnish - parsely
