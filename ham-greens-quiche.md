## Ingredients

 - 2 tablespoons finely minced shallots
 - 2 tablespoons butter
 - 1 + 1/4 cups chopped Swiss chard
 - 1/2 teaspoon salt
 - 1/2 teaspoon pepper
 - 1/2 cup of diced ham or lamb, depending on preference
 - 4 eggs
 - 1 + 1/4 cups whipping cream
 - 1 generous pinch nutmeg
 - one 9” pie shell
 - 1 cup grated swiss cheese
 
 ## Directions
 
 - Preheat oven to 400°F and bake pie shell on a baking sheet for 9-10 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool. Reduce oven temperature to 375°.
 - In a medium skillet over medium heat, melt butter. Add shallots and sauté 3-5 minutes . Add chard and stir for several minutes, until most of its water has cooked out.
 - In a medium mixing bowl, beat eggs, cream, salt, pepper and nutmeg. Place sautéed chard, meat, and about 2/3 of the cheese into the bottom of the pie shell. Pour in egg mixture. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese.
 - Bake in preheated oven for 25 - 30 minutes. The quiche is done when a knife plunged into the center comes out clean.
