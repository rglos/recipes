# Chili

I typically double this recipe and make a double batch for freezing and pulling out on weeknights.  So you are seeing the 2x version below.

Also use dried beans and make them ahead instead of using canned version.

## Ingredients

### Beans
- 200g dried black beans
- 200g dried kidney beans
- 200g dried pinto beans

### Chili

- 2 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 onion, diced (2 cup)
- 2 red bell pepper, diced (2 cup)
- 4 carrots, diced (2 cup)
- 4 teaspoons ground cumin
- 2 pound extra-lean ground beef (90 percent lean)
- 2 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes
- 4 cups water
- 2 chipotle chile in adobo sauce, seeded and minced
- 4 teaspoons adobo sauce from the can of chipotles
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper

Heat the oil in large pot or Dutch oven over moderate heat. Add the onion, bell pepper and carrots, cover and cook, stirring occasionally until the vegetables are soft, about 10 minutes. Add the cumin and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the ground beef; raise the heat to high and cook, breaking up the meat with a spoon, until the meat is no longer pink. Stir in the tomatoes, water, chipotle and adobo sauce, oregano and salt and pepper. Simmer, partially covered, stirring from time to time, for 30 minutes. Stir in the beans and cook, partially covered, 20 minutes longer. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.

### Variations

 - Use chunks of any kind of beef instead of ground beef.
 - Use homemade chili, dried, etc.. instead of adobo souce store bought stuff
