# Pasta Genovese - Beef Sause
## Ingredients 

Enough sauce for 2 pounds of dry rigatoni (8 servings):

 - Once beef is browned, turn to medium high, add in diced carrots, celery, pancetta, black pepper, salt and cook for 5 minutes to soften veg
 - Add tomato paste, bay leaf, white wine - purpose deglaze pot
 - Turn heat to medium, add massive amount of sliced onions, if onions don't all fit, reserve and add as they cook
