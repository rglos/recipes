# Honey Garlic Shrimp

Make the marinade up to 1-2 days before.  Then combine with shrimp 30-60 minutes before cooking.  Marinate in the refrigerator for 30 to 60 minutes; toss occasionally while marinating.

## Ingredients

Merinade

- 1 tablespoon minced fresh garlic
- 2 tablespoons honey
- Â½ teaspoon freshly grated ginger
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce, or more to taste (3 tablespoons)
- 1 teaspoon Asian fish sauce, or to taste

For the pan
- 1 pound large raw shrimp (16-20 count), peeled and deveined
- 2 teaspoons vegetable oil for the pan
- 1 bowl of snap peas or some other vegetable (brocolli, grean beans) to saute in pan


## Directions

Whisk garlic, honey, ginger, soy sauce, and fish sauce together in a bowl.

Add shrimp and toss thoroughly with a spatula for 2 minutes until completely coated. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 30 to 60 minutes; toss occasionally while marinating.

Brush a large nonstick skillet with oil and heat over high heat until you begin to see small wisps of smoke. Use tongs to immediately transfer shrimp into the hot skillet in a single layer. Set excess marinade aside.

Saute the vegetable and then set aside.

Add more oil.

Sear shrimp for 2 minutes, then flip over. Dump in marinade and cook for 1 minute. Turn off heat and flip shrimp once more; let sit for about 1 minute. The marinade in the pan will reduce down to a beautiful glaze just from the residual heat in the pan. Garnish with vegetable.
