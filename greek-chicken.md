# Ingredients

 * 6 bone-in skin-on thighs
 * OR 1 whole chicken, cut in sections,
 * OR 4 pounds chicken thighs bone-in, skin-on
 * 3-4 russet potatoes, cut in quarters
 * 1 tablespoon kosher salt
 * 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
 * 1 tsp dried rosemary
 * 1 rounded tablespoon dried oregano
 * (optional) pinch of cayenne
 * (optional) 6 cloves of garlic, finely minced
 * 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice
 * 1/2 cup olive oil
 * (optional) 2/3 cup chicken broth for the pan, plus a splash to deglaze after roasting
 * (optional) fresh chopped oregano to garnish

# Directions

Put all ingredients, except broth and garnish, into bowl and let marinate all day.

Roast at 425 for about 45 minutes, or until the chicken is well browned and cooked through.  Usually I use cast iron skillet, spread out potatoes and chicken evenly, skin side up.
