# Ingredients

 * 6 bone-in skin-on thighs
 * OR 1 whole chicken, cut in sections,
 * OR 6 chicken thighs bone-in, skin-on
 * OR 6 chicken thighs boneless - cook potatoes 20-25 min THEN add chicken
 * 3-4 russet potatoes, cut in quarters
 * 1 tablespoon kosher salt
 * 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
 * 1 tsp dried rosemary
 * 1 rounded tablespoon dried oregano
 * (optional) pinch of cayenne
 * (optional) 6 cloves of garlic, finely minced
 * 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice
 * 1/2 cup olive oil
 * (optional) 2/3 cup chicken broth for the pan, plus a splash to deglaze after roasting
 * (optional) fresh chopped oregano to garnish

# Directions

Put all ingredients, except broth and garnish, into bowl and let marinate all day.

Roast at 425 for about 45 minutes, or until the chicken is well browned and cooked through.  Usually I use cast iron skillet, spread out potatoes and chicken evenly, skin side up.  An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F.

Transfer chicken to serving platter and keep warm.

Set oven to broil or highest heat setting. Toss potatoes once again in pan juices. Place pan under broiler and broil until potatoes are caramelized, about 3 minutes. Transfer potatoes to serving platter with chicken.

Place roasting pan on stove over medium heat. Add a splash of broth and stir up browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Strain; spoon juices over chicken and potatoes. Top with chopped oregano.
